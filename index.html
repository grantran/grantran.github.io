            <ul>
              <p>Hi, I'm a full-stack developer in Vancouver, BC. I like data, cool technology, and building useful stuff. I enjoy learning 
                pretty much any technology, anywhere in a stack, and I like to wear different hats in everything I do. Take a look below to 
                learn more about my experiences.  
              </p>
              <!-- <p>
                I am a full-stack developer with experience in data science &amp; analytics. Formerly a biologist, I've
                become interested in the data space in both analytics &amp; data infrastructure. I enjoy problem solving, wearing many hats, 
                and the latest &amp; greatest technology. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently with the Vancouver Canucks, I'm looking to continue growing as a developer in different fields &amp; applications. 
                You'll find my experiences below, along with all the different hats I've worn in the past.

                batch correction, and hierarchical clustering to examine microarray and next generation sequencing data.

              <p class="description">My science career started by just being curious of how things worked, particularly in chemistry and eventually biology. I was not satisfied with phrases such as "your body will adapt" or "the cell will mount a response". I always wanted to dig deeper, go smaller, 
                understand how mechanistically things (i.e proteins, genes) interacted at a chemical level. Eventually that led to biochemistry and what seems natural now, 
                drugs and pharmacogenomics.

                  Outside of work, I am a huge hockey fan. Since I'm with the Canucks, I am usually either working, watching, or playing hockey in some capacity. I 
                  enjoy many other sports, including volleyball, golf, and tennis. I enjoy organizing events and recretional teams, always wanting to bring my

                  company. Recently I went to a ceramics workshop with my girlfriend and made a pretty questionable whale plant pot, which is now the home to a
